Going through the available packages that have something with 3d, I find

des, deinprogramm seem to have noting to do with 3d, though they show up on the 3d search

3d-model -- some code dealing with a collection of named triangle meshes as representatinos for objects.
But: it's not clear how this is to be used for graphics, because it has no opengl support.  It deals with vertices, triangles, uv-coordinates, and polygons.  My guess is that uv-coordinates are there to deal with texture-mapping, but there is no actual indication of this in the documentation.

glfw3 -- appears to be abinding for glfw.  The code seems to make and manipulate windows.  i presume this is for the use of opengl.

js-voxel -- a general-purpose voxel programming environment
Currently compiles, but tests fail.

lindenmayer -- draws trees

opencv -- binding to the opencv library,  What is this?

OpenGL -- an automatically generated wrapper around the OpenGL library.  These procedures are UNSAFE.  Save before running.

pict3d-orig
pict3d-die-cut
pict3d

It's not clear hos pict3d and pict3d-orig are related.  It's possible pict3d-orig is an older version, and the studying it may yield insights into pict3d.  Or one may just have a few bug-fixes over the other,

pict3d.notes contains my notes on pict3d, insofar as I've discovered anything.

voxel -- voxe space progrmming -- Seems ralated to js-voxel, but I'm not sure how.

ruckus -- CAD graphics scientific

quaternion -- quaternion arithmetic.  Rotations without gimbal-lock

plot-doc
plot-gui-lib
plot-lib
plot-test

These would seem to be plotting libraries.  They are graded white, which presumably meand theres no informatin whether they copile or run.
